<h2> 10 Things I Hate ABOUT You</h2>
<h4> Best Quotes: </h4>
<p> “I know you can be underwhelmed, and you can be overwhelmed, but can you ever just be, like, whelmed?”
    <br>
    "You know, there’s a difference between like and love. I like my Skechers but I love my Prada backpack.”
    <br> </br> 
    <span> “I hate the way you talk to me, and the way you cut your hair
        I hate the way you drive my car. I hate it when you stare.
        I hate your big dumb combat boots, and the way you read my mind.
        I hate you so much it makes me sick; it even makes me rhyme!
        I hate it, I hate the way you’re always right. I hate it when you lie.
        I hate it when you make me laugh, even worse when you make me cry.
        I hate it when you’re not around, and the fact that you didn’t call.
        But mostly I hate the way I don’t hate you.
        Not even close, not even a little bit, not even at all.”"  </span>
